## What is Vim Canvas‚Ñ¢Ô∏è?
Vim is the middleware platform for healthcare. Vim Canvas‚Ñ¢Ô∏è is a self-service platform that empowers application developers to embed their application into Electronic Health Record (EHR) workflows, resulting in a streamlined and low-friction experience for end users. With Vim, you can deploy your applications on top of Vim Connect - Vim's in-EHR connectivity layer - accelerating time to market at reduced cost and improved flexibility.

# Repo Overview üòé

This repo contains example projects for building applications on top of Vim Canvas‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.
The applications in different frameworks demonstrates how to use the VimOS.js Canvas‚Ñ¢Ô∏è SDK to interact with the Vim Canvas‚Ñ¢Ô∏è platform. The app showcases the following features:

* Authentication with Vim Canvas‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
* Embedding an application into the Vim Canvas‚Ñ¢Ô∏è platform
* Viewing EHR entities, including
  * Patients
  * Encounters
  * Referrals
  * Orders
* Updating EHR entities, including
  * Encounters
  * Referrals

## Vim Canvas‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Demo App (React)

Under the `vim-canvas-demo-app-react` we have a project that uses cloudflare pages to host the Vim Canvas‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Demo App built with React & also the serverless service needed for the authentication flow.

The app is built with `vite` and `react` and uses `shadcn`, `radix-ui`,`tailwindcss` for the UI components.

### Folder Structure

* `functions` - Contains [cloudflare pages functions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/) for the authentication flow.
* `src/components/ui` - Contains UI components generated with [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
* `src/hooks` - Contains custom hooks for the application, including hooks that wrap the VimOS.js Canvas‚Ñ¢Ô∏è SDK - [following the docs examples](https://docs.getvim.com/vim-os-js/reactjs.html#react-integration-guide-for-vimos.js).

### Running the example code

#### Prerequisites
In order to see the demo code in action, you must first configure an application in the [Vim Canvas‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Developer Platform](https://console.getvim.com/organization-admin/).

If you don‚Äôt have a Vim Canvas‚Ñ¢Ô∏è developer account yet, register [here](https://getvim.com/vim-canvas-developer-platform/) to gain access.

> ‚ùï **You don't need a cloudflare user / account** to run the app locally.

#### Installation

To install and run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getvim/vim-canvas-demo-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd vim-canvas-demo-app-react
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Create a `.dev.vars` file with the following content:

```.env
CLIENT_ID=<<YOU ACCOUNT CLIENT ID>>
CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR ACCOUNT CLIENT SECRET>>
REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:8788
```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> This will start both the backend at `http://localhost:8788` and the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`. <br>
The backend will proxy the frontend - **making both API & frontend available at `http://localhost:8788`**.

6. Follow up on [Testing Your Application](https://docs.getvim.com/platform/testing.html#testing-your-application) in the official docs

### Authentication Flow

The `functions` folder is a cloudflare pages function that handles the authentication flow for the app.

When running locally the api server starts at `http://localhost:8788` & exposes the following endpoints:
* `/api/launch` - This endpoint is used to initiate the authentication flow.
* `/api/token` - This endpoint is used to handle the callback from the Vim Canvas‚Ñ¢Ô∏è platform to create a token.
