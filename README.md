## What is Vim Canvas™️?
Vim is the middleware platform for healthcare. Vim Canvas™️ is a self-service platform that empowers application developers to embed their application into Electronic Health Record (EHR) workflows, resulting in a streamlined and low-friction experience for end users. With Vim, you can deploy your applications on top of Vim Connect - Vim's in-EHR connectivity layer - accelerating time to market at reduced cost and improved flexibility.

# Repo Overview 😎

This repo contains example projects for building applications on top of Vim Canvas™️.
The applications in different frameworks demonstrates how to use the VimOS.js Canvas™️ SDK to interact with the Vim Canvas™️ platform. The app showcases the following features:

* Authentication with Vim Canvas™️
* Embedding an application into the Vim Canvas™️ platform
* Viewing EHR entities, including
  * Patients
  * Encounters
  * Referrals
  * Orders
* Updating EHR entities, including
  * Encounters
  * Referrals

## Vim Canvas™️ Demo App (React)

Under the `vim-canvas-demo-app-react` we have a project that uses cloudflare pages to host the Vim Canvas™️ Demo App built with React & also the serverless service needed for the authentication flow.

The app is built with `vite` and `react` and uses `shadcn`, `radix-ui`,`tailwindcss` for the UI components, and Cloudfare for back end authentication flow. 
These are only front end and back end libraries or languages that are used as examples in the demo app. 
You can use Vim OS SDK in any front or back end language or libraries you are currently using if you already have an application.


### Folder Structure

* `functions` - Contains [cloudflare pages functions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/) for the authentication flow.
* `src/components/ui` - Contains UI components generated with [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
* `src/hooks` - Contains custom hooks for the application, including hooks that wrap the VimOS.js Canvas™️ SDK - [following the docs examples](https://docs.getvim.com/vim-os-js/reactjs.html#react-integration-guide-for-vimos.js).

### Running the example code

#### Prerequisites
In order to see the demo code in action, you must first configure an application in the [Vim Canvas™️ Developer Platform](https://console.getvim.com/organization-admin/).

If you don’t have a Vim Canvas™️ developer account yet, register [here](https://getvim.com/vim-canvas-developer-platform/) to gain access.

> ❕ **You don't need a cloudflare user / account** to run the app locally.

#### Installation

To install and run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getvim/vim-canvas-demo-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd vim-canvas-demo-app-react
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Create a `.dev.vars` file with the following content:

```.env
CLIENT_ID=<<YOU ACCOUNT CLIENT ID>>
CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR ACCOUNT CLIENT SECRET>>
REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:8788
```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> This will start both the backend at `http://localhost:8788` and the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`. <br>
The backend will proxy the frontend - **making both API & frontend available at `http://localhost:8788`**.

6. Follow up on [Testing Your Application](https://docs.getvim.com/testing/creating-application.html#create-your-canvas-application) in the official docs

### Authentication Flow

The `functions` folder is a cloudflare pages function that handles the authentication flow for the app.

When running locally the api server starts at `http://localhost:8788` & exposes the following endpoints:
* `/api/launch` - This endpoint is used to initiate the authentication flow.
* `/api/token` - This endpoint is used to handle the callback from the Vim Canvas™️ platform to create a token.

## Settings Application Demo

On top of using VimOS.js to integrate your application's iframe within Vim Connect and display it in the Vim Hub on EHRs, you can also inject an additional optional iframe into the Vim Console. This allows you to create a dedicated Settings Application where organization administrators can customize and configure your main application.

This settings application is implemented under `/settings` route.
